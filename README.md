# Whatsapp Auto Sender
## Send a single message to a contact

This is a very simple python script to send a message to a whatsapp contact on your 
phone.

## To run
``python send_message.py "Your message" "Friend's name"``

## Drawbacks
* Contact needs to be on your phone

## Todo
* Send message to multiple contacts i.e broadcast list without the 256 limit
* Send message to a non-contact number
* Load phone numbers from a list  (csv, db or text file) and send a broadcast message

## Bugs
Selenium still not working out of the box on docker. Still needs a little bit of tweaking
